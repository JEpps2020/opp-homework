In this project, I have created a functional application that allows the team lead to populate the data items for their team members. 

I successfully created all of my classes with constructor functions and passed all tests. I then installed my dependencies which were "inquirer," "path" and "fs." In the app.js file, I created the const teamArray to ultimately push my input values entered for the manager, engineer, and intern prompts into an array- using the code in the changeMembers() function to iterate through the the possible team member types, until the team leader no longer wishes to add any more members. Finally, the fs.writeFile function was used generate the htm file with cards.
